# NFL_Combine_Results_vs_School_Prestige

The goal of this project is to visualize the relationship between combine results, school prestiage, and when/if a player is drafted. See notebooks/Combine_Results_vs_School_Prestige.ipynb for the final result!

I estimate the prestige of the school a player is coming from by pulling the salary of the head coach in 2025. This assumes that large, big name programs pay their head coaches more than smaller schools with less resources allocatted to football. While it is not perfect, I think the correlation is high enough for the purpose of this project.

I pull basic combine results for the last 10 years.
